But that would require political and economically minded people to come forward and guide the country. We’ll be spiraling for years either way. Our education system needs to be dismantled and reworked as well. It was designed by Rockefeller to create factory workers and cogs in their capitalistic wheel not about really educating people.

politics,mexico,Team Trump Is Actually Drawing Up Attack Plans for Mexico,"Is there anyone in the US capable of taking responsibility for US actions?

* The US needs cheap, manual labor - Mexico supplies it
* The US has an apparently insatiable appetite for drugs - Mexico supply them

Yet, rather than focus on reducing demand for cheap manual labor &/or drugs, it seems everyone in the US thinks that all of the fault lies with Mexico.

If the US had no jobs for illegals, most would stop coming.

If the US didn't buy illegal drugs, Mexico would stop making them.

politics,mexico,Team Trump Is Actually Drawing Up Attack Plans for Mexico,"This fucking goon knows his our economy is absolutely HYPER FUCKED because he decided to officially roll back Dodd-Frank in 2018 and absolutely blow up stateside yen carry trades.

If Japan raises interest rates to save their economy from inevitable hyper-inflation, our borrowers cant afford to repay them for all the yen they borrowed near or at 0%. Those same borrowers are over-leveraged here to the tune of no less than 34:1. Many of those borrowers are also Wall Street's biggest players, and are engaged in all sorts of Grey-at-best activity. It only takes one domino to fall and the entire house of cards they've erected toppled.

So what would a mindless, spineless coward hack do to save us? He would lazily wear the 1 shoe that fits all and take a replicate conditions he's seen economies recover from in our past history. 

#1 hedge his own assets against the collapsing dollar with crypto. Inventing his own shitcoin was his little touch. Thanks Eric and Baron!

#2 HE thinks tariffs were a major factor in saving us from the Great Depression- (which is what economists warn our fate may be worse than.) He forgets about the Dust Bowl, but he can barely read so whatever... he read the foot notes, and farmers are fucked.

#3 He saw FDR turn things around by gearing up for WW2. Now all we need is to get on the winning side of a good ol American war. Russia/Ukraine is too flippy floppy, but hes now leaning BACK to Putin. We could also just play it safe and just invade a country like Greenland, Canada or... Mexico.

Yes. This has a been a work in progress for Trump/GOP since Trump's first term and was being planned out during Biden's term. And since it's been years in the making, yes this is serious. 

------

First term Trump wanted to [shoot patriot missiles into Mexico and deny it was the US](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/us/politics/mark-esper-book-trump.html) according to his defense secretary Mark Esper. Trump asked him about it twice! Then the elected GOP agreed and started to prepare both rhetorically and began to write up authorization for Trump to do so.

> House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., on Tuesday said it was “a mistake” that then-President Donald Trump did not bomb meth labs in Mexico after he had reportedly asked his defense secretary about the possibility in 2020.

> The Republican push to use military force in Mexico against drug cartels started in the Trump White House. He has plans to make the idea a reality in 2025.

> On Capitol Hill, Republican lawmakers have drafted a broad authorization for the use of military force against cartels — echoing the war powers Congress gave former President George W. Bush before the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. They have also pushed for designating Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organizations — a related idea Mr. Trump flirted with as president but backed off after Mexico hotly objected. Now, if Mr. Trump returns to the White House in 2025, he has vowed to push for the designations and to deploy Special Operations troops and naval forces to, as he put it, declare war on the cartels.

Center for Global Development estimates that USAIDsaves 2.3 million to 5.6 million lives per year.  From 2001 to 2021 it is estimate that USAID prevented over 90 million deaths, with the biggest impact  in preventing deaths from tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria. Trump gutted the program.

He's demonstrated that he doesn't value the lives of immigrants or legal citizens with darker skin. He's willing to lock them up or ship them to a concentration camp. Every day new stories emerge of the injustices....old people who have raised military members, immigrants doing backbreaking work in our fields, young children suffering from terminal cancer, shipped away as a death sentence.

Trump doesn't understand the sacrifice of soldiers (aka ""suckers"") who died for our freedom. Why would he give a second thought about  starting a war in Mexico. He won't care how many people he kills, including US soldiers.

politics,mexico,Trump Is Ready to Invade U.S. Ally if It Doesn’t Cave to His Demands - Donald Trump has drawn up attack plans for Mexico.,"The whole war on drugs thing was a farce when you have military members and local law enforcement officers working with cartels and criminals to bring drugs to the American people. I've always believed that some sort of military intervention would be needed if the USA truly wanted to combat drugs, followed by extended armed policing or colonization for it to truly eradicate the danger of cartels.

These clickbait publications are so eager to pull views they unabashedly say something like this, when all officials interviewed say “There is no plan and that’s part of the problem with Trump.”

I’d be more concerned about him pushing any special forces strike at all, as he’s been floating. It would be a total disaster for no discernible gain. Trying to frame it as an “invasion” plan is just more exaggeration. He would have to face congress if he did that, and he does all he can to sidestep that necessity that might cut it off. A strike is more his style anyway.
