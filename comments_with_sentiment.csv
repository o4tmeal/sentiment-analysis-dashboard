worldnews,war,Russia Won't End Ukraine War Until NATO 'Pulls Out' of Baltics: Moscow,"Nazi excuse to invade Poland sound familiar?



>The English wanted this war in the crazy hope that it was their last chance to stop Germany’s growing strength. They passionately avoided doing anything that might have prevented war. Rather than encouraging Poland to accept the Führer’s generous proposals to resolve the situation, they encouraged it to let the deadline pass, thereby providing a reason for war. The Führer felt obliged to strike back only after Polish troops had crossed the German border at several places. The German fight is a defensive fight. We fight because we were forced to fight by the insults and demands against us, because of the brutal suppression of ethnic Germans in Poland, and because of the open announcements that they would do everything in their power to strangle National Socialist Germany through military or economic means.

>**What are we fighting for?**

>We are fighting for our most valuable possession: our freedom. We are fighting for our land and our skies. We are fighting so that our children will not be slaves of foreign rulers. That is in no way an exaggeration or empty phrase.

>We know that we will be slaves if we do not win and we know that the goal of [England’s policy of encirclement](https://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/wehr02.htm) is to subject Germany to its will. We know what that means. We all remember the days when Allied inspectors wandered around Germany.

>We are fighting for Germany’s freedom and for Germany’s right to be a people that has all it needs to preserve its national existence. The Führer made unprecedented offers for peace and understanding to those who are now fighting against Germany. His attempts were scornfully rejected because they wanted this fight.

>We are fighting for a lasting peace that will make a repetition of Versailles impossible. For two long decades, it caused an enormous, constantly bleeding wound among the ethnic Germans in the East. We are fighting to save our children from the unbearable threats of the Western democracies, driven by envy and hatred. We are fighting for a happy future in a free Germany in a peaceful Europe.",13,2025-06-09 19:57:52,2078,https://www.newsweek.com/russia-end-ukraine-war-nato-baltics-2082912,NEGATIVE,-0.6665587425231934

news,war,Stocks fall as Trump warns of US economy trade war 'transition',"I really really REALLY don't understand all these self proclaimed investors (I mean, I do, they're just addicted gamblers): Trump is NOTORIOUS for getting into a business and announcing well ahead what he is going to do.


Here's the thing: he's a compete moron. Everything he wants to do is utter nonsense at best and economic suicide at worst. He's too incoherent to even be a con man, all the scams that earned him money were not coordinated by him. He spent HALF A CENTURY making absolutely transparent that anything he's capable of doing with a business is crashing it to the ground while syphoning all the cash into lavish and gaudy garbage.

He's the only man that started a multi millionaire, loaned and  evaded taxes for HALF A BILLION USD, invested the most stable and lucrative market of the century (real estates) and, accounting inflation, didn't make actual money over his whole life. His highest pride is his brand, which business's plan is (*drumroll*)... selling cheap crap at astronomical prices by posing them as luxury stuff. Too bad that the actual rich people find that stuff posh and disgusting, while those that like them are the uneducated poors (because that don't know what quality stuff looks like). To put it simply, his business plan is trying to sell expensive, horrible garbage to those who cannot buy them even if they liked them.


He doesn't understand business planning. He doesn't understand money management. He doesn't even understand basic economic fundamentals like offer and demand. Hell, he probably doesn't even understand elementary school math. He's a narcissist that has repeatedly proven that he'll do exactly what he says and what he says is absolute economic and diplomatic suicide. Every sane person knew and pointed out that even only on the economic side, Trump II would have been a disaster.


AND YET millions of people tough to invest into him and his economic plan. That's not even being a greedy, unscrupulous parasite without any moral compass: that's just being a junkie addicted to gambling doing stupid choices masking as an investor. The US has revealed what it actually is: the largest drug den on the planet.",5,2025-03-10 21:08:41,2881,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz61nn99eg1o,NEGATIVE,-0.9235621690750122

Although, now that you’re moving into a more imperial style presidency America, maybe you need to learn from people who knew how to deal with royal favorites. Here’s a few examples for you: 

Piers Gaveston (d. 1312) – Favorite of Edward II of England
Piers Gaveston was the intimate companion (and possibly lover) of Edward II, who showered him with titles and wealth. His arrogance and open contempt for the English nobility, including calling them by insulting nicknames, made him a prime target for their wrath. After repeated exiles and returns, a group of barons captured him, put him through a sham trial, and executed him—reportedly by stabbing him through the heart and beheading him.

Robert Cochrane (d. 1482) – Favorite of James III of Scotland
Cochrane rose to become James III’s chief advisor, earning the nobility’s scorn for his low birth and the king’s preference for him over traditional Scottish lords. During a rebellion against James III, Scottish nobles hanged Cochrane from Lauder Bridge along with other royal favorites, supposedly using a crude rope made from horse tack.

George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham (assassinated in 1628) – Favorite of James I and Charles I of England
Buckingham was extraordinarily close to both James I and his son Charles I, accumulating immense power. His failed military campaigns, monopolization of royal favor, and extravagant lifestyle made him deeply resented. He was stabbed to death by a disgruntled army officer, John Felton, who believed Buckingham had betrayed England through his military incompetence. Felton was hailed as a hero by many.",2,2025-03-21 05:32:34,1156,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/politics/musk-pentagon-briefing-china-war-plan.html?unlocked_article_code=1.5k4.SRAZ.aIZGK_LvUkAE&smid=nytcore-android-share,NEGATIVE,-0.6455051898956299

Just hook some jumper cables up to the black underground pyramid in the Alaskan Yukon and connect it to Seattle. I'm sure all our defense contractors in the area can then figure out how to power the rest of the United States from there, including border cities. 

And since you'll have to run your jumper across Canada, might as well give them some free unlimited electricity from mother Gaia too. My grandpa was a civil engineer and I think I missed my calling.... LoL. Kinda like Phat. Just so we're all on the same page, jumper cables aren't needed... It's part of the irony but imagining jumper cables stretched from Alaska to the continental United States, over Canada, is way funnier in my head 🤷🏻

They control pretty much every level of government in the majority of states and at the federal level. Dems are a true failed party at the national level.

As a result, republicans don’t have any unifying enemy that’s worthwhile battling and are faction-ating over major issues. Which makes sense, this is a major issue. 

A lot of people held their nose and voted for Trump this time around because of a single issue they wanted. Issues like entering another middle eastern war or arresting citizens is enough to separate different MAGA camps.",51,2025-06-17 18:05:18,2707,https://www.latintimes.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-says-americans-have-been-brainwashed-fox-news-new-york-post-she-opposes-585151,NEGATIVE,-0.6115415692329407

It is just a distraction. Neither Tucker Carlson or Ted Cruz are part of the administration. Cruz is a high profile Republican but not currently in leadership. Cruz can shop taking points and wrestle a bit (with a friendly media source)  ways to sell a justification for war without it impacting the governments official position. If Marco Rubio had the same conversation it would reflect on official policy because Rubio is Sec of State. Cruz is nothing. 

Cruz, MTG, Graham, and other Republicans that are disconnected from the Cabinet will flood the zone with various arguments for and against bombing Iran. None of those arguments being official. Then the Administration with coalesce around which ever ones work day to day. Cruz is arguing with Tucker to create the appearance of Republicans having a substantive debate and position on Iran. 

It is just cover to obscure from that fact that no one knows what is happening. The conditions in Iran appear to be the same as they've been for 15yrs. Netanyahu has been saying Iran was weeks away from a nuclear weapon for decades. Why Israel has pulled the trigger and Trump appears ready jump in too isn't clear at the moment. Cruz and Tucker are just stalling until Trump does whatever it is Trump will do. 

If Trump stands down Tucker will applaud Trump for his cool headedness and Cruz will just go back to being quiet. If Trump bombs Iran Cruz will applaud and Tucker will become quiet.

politics,war,"This time, it’s Trump’s war","President Donald Trump claimed during his 2024 campaign for president that America had fought “no wars” during his first presidency, and that he was the first president in 72 years who could say that.

[This was not](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/13/trump-falsely-claims-no-terrorist-attacks-no-wars-during-his-presidency/), strictly speaking, true. In his first term, Trump intensified the [air war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria,](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/23/us-air-wars-trump) ordered airstrikes against Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian regime in response to chemical weapons use, and escalated a [little-noticed counterinsurgency campaign in Somalia](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/03/trump-administration-somalia-war-civilian-casualties.html). But in those cases, Trump could say, with some justification, that he was just dealing with festering crises he had inherited from Barack Obama.

Likewise, the president has repeatedly claimed that the wars in Gaza and Ukraine never would have happened had he been president when they broke out, rather than Joe Biden. That’s a counterfactual that is impossible to prove, and he [may have been overly optimistic](https://www.vox.com/world-politics/405452/ceasefires-gaza-ukraine-trump-diplomacy) in his promises to quickly negotiate an end to both those conflicts, but it’s fair to say that both are wars Trump inherited rather than chose.

This time, it’s different. This time, it’s Trump’s war.

On Saturday night, the United States bombed three nuclear sites in Iran at Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan, [ending weeks of speculation](https://www.vox.com/world-politics/416774/iran-israel-attack-us-war) about whether the US military would join the Israeli war on Iran that began more than a week ago.

ONE STEP CLOSER TO WORLD WAR III, THANKS TO TRUMP (OVER ANOTHER LIE OF WMDs)

Why is it that Israel, who illegally have Nukes, is not being forced to give up their Nukes? If the U.S. can attack Iran over lies of Nukes, then China and Russia should bomb Israel, which we all know has Nukes.  Remember when Kennedy tried to attack Cuba, and Russia came to their aid, ready to provide Nukes if the US did not step back. Will Russia or China have to do the same now to protect Iran?

Will the American people allow Trump to enter us into another Middle East war, causing many American deaths, and like Iraq and Afghanistan, accomplishing nothing but death and wounded soldiers?

If China or Russia do not get involved, then they will be handing not only Iran but the entire Middle East to the United States. Russia and China cannot sit on the sidelines. They have no choice but to enter the war, for they know if they allow the U.S. to take over the Middle East, their next move will be against them. When World War III starts, may the world remember that Donald Trump started it!

politics,war,The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans,"This is absolutely staggering. I’m still trying to process the fact that senior U.S. officials—people at the highest levels of government—were casually texting war plans over Signal, an app that’s not even approved for classified communications. Not only that, but they accidentally added a journalist to the group chat. And then? Just carried on like nothing happened. No one noticed. No one asked questions. They dropped operational details, discussed strategy, named targets, and then capped it all off with high-five emojis.

It’s not just irresponsible—it’s surreal. This isn’t a parody or a leaked TV script. This happened. They talked about military strikes the same way people coordinate a fantasy football draft. And then, as if to hammer home just how broken our national security culture has become, they celebrated the bombing of a foreign country with emojis. Fire, flags, praying hands, muscle arms. Like they’d just won a pickup basketball game.

What’s worse—what really makes my blood boil—is that nothing will come of it. Nothing. There won’t be hearings. No one will be fired. There won’t even be a slap on the wrist. The fact that a sitting Secretary of Defense might have violated the Espionage Act by leaking sensitive war plans over an unsecured app to a journalist should be a full-blown national scandal. Instead? Silence. Shrugs. Maybe a Fox News segment praising how ""tough"" the response was.

It’s the normalization of absurdity. It’s government by group chat, with the fate of lives—American and otherwise—being tossed around like a Twitter thread. And the most horrifying part? They all seem to think this is fine. Routine. Standard operating procedure.

This is bigger than partisan politics. This is about the breakdown of basic standards—of competence, of professionalism, of decency.
