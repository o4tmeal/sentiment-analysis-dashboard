>The English wanted this war in the crazy hope that it was their last chance to stop Germany’s growing strength. They passionately avoided doing anything that might have prevented war. Rather than encouraging Poland to accept the Führer’s generous proposals to resolve the situation, they encouraged it to let the deadline pass, thereby providing a reason for war. The Führer felt obliged to strike back only after Polish troops had crossed the German border at several places. The German fight is a defensive fight. We fight because we were forced to fight by the insults and demands against us, because of the brutal suppression of ethnic Germans in Poland, and because of the open announcements that they would do everything in their power to strangle National Socialist Germany through military or economic means.

>**What are we fighting for?**

>We are fighting for our most valuable possession: our freedom. We are fighting for our land and our skies. We are fighting so that our children will not be slaves of foreign rulers. That is in no way an exaggeration or empty phrase.

>We know that we will be slaves if we do not win and we know that the goal of [England’s policy of encirclement](https://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/wehr02.htm) is to subject Germany to its will. We know what that means. We all remember the days when Allied inspectors wandered around Germany.

>We are fighting for Germany’s freedom and for Germany’s right to be a people that has all it needs to preserve its national existence. The Führer made unprecedented offers for peace and understanding to those who are now fighting against Germany. His attempts were scornfully rejected because they wanted this fight.

>We are fighting for a lasting peace that will make a repetition of Versailles impossible. For two long decades, it caused an enormous, constantly bleeding wound among the ethnic Germans in the East. We are fighting to save our children from the unbearable threats of the Western democracies, driven by envy and hatred. We are fighting for a happy future in a free Germany in a peaceful Europe.",11,2025-06-09 19:57:52,2081,https://www.newsweek.com/russia-end-ukraine-war-nato-baltics-2082912,NEGATIVE,-0.6665587425231934

worldnews,war,U.S. tells allies it won't join war unless Iran targets Americans,"I speculate what is about to happen will be argued to be the only way to stop an escalation into war.

It is all over the news that the President has left the G7 to return to Washington DC to meet with the National Security Council in the White House Situation Room.

I speculate an ultimatum will be given to Iran to either stand down or evacuate their sites at Fordow and Natanz, especially the underground sites.  I speculate the B2 bombers may already be on their way with their bunker buster bombs to finish the matter, from the US perspective, if Iran refuses to back down.

The argument will be that removing Fordow and Natanz from the equation will leave both Israel and Iran with nothing but pointless bombings, drone strikes, and missile exchanges.  There will be no reason to not agree to an immediate ceasefire.

Here's the thing: he's a compete moron. Everything he wants to do is utter nonsense at best and economic suicide at worst. He's too incoherent to even be a con man, all the scams that earned him money were not coordinated by him. He spent HALF A CENTURY making absolutely transparent that anything he's capable of doing with a business is crashing it to the ground while syphoning all the cash into lavish and gaudy garbage.

He's the only man that started a multi millionaire, loaned and  evaded taxes for HALF A BILLION USD, invested the most stable and lucrative market of the century (real estates) and, accounting inflation, didn't make actual money over his whole life. His highest pride is his brand, which business's plan is (*drumroll*)... selling cheap crap at astronomical prices by posing them as luxury stuff. Too bad that the actual rich people find that stuff posh and disgusting, while those that like them are the uneducated poors (because that don't know what quality stuff looks like). To put it simply, his business plan is trying to sell expensive, horrible garbage to those who cannot buy them even if they liked them.


He doesn't understand business planning. He doesn't understand money management. He doesn't even understand basic economic fundamentals like offer and demand. Hell, he probably doesn't even understand elementary school math. He's a narcissist that has repeatedly proven that he'll do exactly what he says and what he says is absolute economic and diplomatic suicide. Every sane person knew and pointed out that even only on the economic side, Trump II would have been a disaster.


AND YET millions of people tough to invest into him and his economic plan. That's not even being a greedy, unscrupulous parasite without any moral compass: that's just being a junkie addicted to gambling doing stupid choices masking as an investor.

Although, now that you’re moving into a more imperial style presidency America, maybe you need to learn from people who knew how to deal with royal favorites. Here’s a few examples for you: 

Piers Gaveston (d. 1312) – Favorite of Edward II of England
Piers Gaveston was the intimate companion (and possibly lover) of Edward II, who showered him with titles and wealth. His arrogance and open contempt for the English nobility, including calling them by insulting nicknames, made him a prime target for their wrath. After repeated exiles and returns, a group of barons captured him, put him through a sham trial, and executed him—reportedly by stabbing him through the heart and beheading him.

Robert Cochrane (d. 1482) – Favorite of James III of Scotland
Cochrane rose to become James III’s chief advisor, earning the nobility’s scorn for his low birth and the king’s preference for him over traditional Scottish lords. During a rebellion against James III, Scottish nobles hanged Cochrane from Lauder Bridge along with other royal favorites, supposedly using a crude rope made from horse tack.

George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham (assassinated in 1628) – Favorite of James I and Charles I of England
Buckingham was extraordinarily close to both James I and his son Charles I, accumulating immense power. His failed military campaigns, monopolization of royal favor, and extravagant lifestyle made him deeply resented. He was stabbed to death by a disgruntled army officer, John Felton, who believed Buckingham had betrayed England through his military incompetence. Felton was hailed as a hero by many.",2,2025-03-21 05:32:34,1156,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/politics/musk-pentagon-briefing-china-war-plan.html?unlocked_article_code=1.5k4.SRAZ.aIZGK_LvUkAE&smid=nytcore-android-share,NEGATIVE,-0.6455051898956299

Over here, the most expensive (necessary) source sets the price, meaning if you have 50% wind, 40% solar and 10% natural gas, the gas price determines the electricity price, and the wind/solar energy can literally be free, but you pay the gas price for all power.

It is just a distraction. Neither Tucker Carlson or Ted Cruz are part of the administration. Cruz is a high profile Republican but not currently in leadership. Cruz can shop taking points and wrestle a bit (with a friendly media source)  ways to sell a justification for war without it impacting the governments official position. If Marco Rubio had the same conversation it would reflect on official policy because Rubio is Sec of State. Cruz is nothing. 

Cruz, MTG, Graham, and other Republicans that are disconnected from the Cabinet will flood the zone with various arguments for and against bombing Iran. None of those arguments being official. Then the Administration with coalesce around which ever ones work day to day. Cruz is arguing with Tucker to create the appearance of Republicans having a substantive debate and position on Iran. 

It is just cover to obscure from that fact that no one knows what is happening. The conditions in Iran appear to be the same as they've been for 15yrs. Netanyahu has been saying Iran was weeks away from a nuclear weapon for decades. Why Israel has pulled the trigger and Trump appears ready jump in too isn't clear at the moment. Cruz and Tucker are just stalling until Trump does whatever it is Trump will do. 

If Trump stands down Tucker will applaud Trump for his cool headedness and Cruz will just go back to being quiet. If Trump bombs Iran Cruz will applaud and Tucker will become quiet. Cruz and Tucker are creating space amongst conservatives for any outcome to be the correct outcome.",6,2025-06-18 11:53:25,1235,https://www.thedailybeast.com/ted-cruz-absolutely-explodes-in-maga-civil-war-gotcha-moment/,NEUTRAL,0.0

What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing.""

TLDR: Author of the article, Jeffery Goldberg, Editor-in-Chief of The Atlantic, says several times that he will not quote certain information in the interests of safety of active agents and real-time intelligence info. From clips of the convo he did include, it appears that top-level people in the President's cabinet fracked up major. **Someone included** ***the editor in chief of The Atlantic*** **in an insecure online messaging discussion of the attack.

politics,war,The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans,"This is absolutely staggering. I’m still trying to process the fact that senior U.S. officials—people at the highest levels of government—were casually texting war plans over Signal, an app that’s not even approved for classified communications. Not only that, but they accidentally added a journalist to the group chat. And then? Just carried on like nothing happened. No one noticed. No one asked questions. They dropped operational details, discussed strategy, named targets, and then capped it all off with high-five emojis.

It’s not just irresponsible—it’s surreal. This isn’t a parody or a leaked TV script. This happened. They talked about military strikes the same way people coordinate a fantasy football draft. And then, as if to hammer home just how broken our national security culture has become, they celebrated the bombing of a foreign country with emojis. Fire, flags, praying hands, muscle arms. Like they’d just won a pickup basketball game.

What’s worse—what really makes my blood boil—is that nothing will come of it. Nothing. There won’t be hearings. No one will be fired. There won’t even be a slap on the wrist. The fact that a sitting Secretary of Defense might have violated the Espionage Act by leaking sensitive war plans over an unsecured app to a journalist should be a full-blown national scandal. Instead? Silence. Shrugs. Maybe a Fox News segment praising how ""tough"" the response was.

It’s the normalization of absurdity. It’s government by group chat, with the fate of lives—American and otherwise—being tossed around like a Twitter thread. And the most horrifying part? They all seem to think this is fine. Routine. Standard operating procedure.

This is bigger than partisan politics. This is about the breakdown of basic standards—of competence, of professionalism, of decency. If this doesn’t trigger national outrage, if this doesn’t result in real consequences, then we’ve officially accepted that chaos, recklessness, and emoji warfare are the new norm.

>The account identified as ""JD Vance"" addressed a message at 8:45 to @Pete Hegseth: ""if you think we should do it let's go. I just hate bailing Europe out again."" (The administration has argued that America's European allies benefit economically from the U.S. Navy's protection of international shipping.  

Who will think of the white knights who always are so selfless.

>The user identified as Hegseth responded three minutes later: ""VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC. 

The audacity to call anyone free loaders. 

>And if there are things we can do upfront to minimize risk to Saudi oil facilities we should do it.
Propagandalf is on the case!
""I will say a prayer for victory,"" Vance wrote.
(Two other users subsequently added prayer emoji.) 

An encore of fucking emojis.

>Several former U.S. officials told Harris and me that they had used Signal to share unclassified information and to discuss routine matters, particularly when traveling overseas without access to U.S. government systems.

>But they knew never to share classified or sensitive information on the app, because their phones could have been hacked by a foreign intelligence service, which would have been able to read the messages on the devices. It is worth noting that Donald Trump, as a candidate for president (and as president), repeatedly and vociferously demanded that Hillary Clinton be imprisoned for using a private email server for official business when she was secretary of state. (It is also worth noting that Trump was indicted in 2023 for mishandling classified documents, but the charges were dropped after his election.)

Males are only buttery when Hillary does it.
