>The English wanted this war in the crazy hope that it was their last chance to stop Germany’s growing strength. They passionately avoided doing anything that might have prevented war. Rather than encouraging Poland to accept the Führer’s generous proposals to resolve the situation, they encouraged it to let the deadline pass, thereby providing a reason for war. The Führer felt obliged to strike back only after Polish troops had crossed the German border at several places. The German fight is a defensive fight. We fight because we were forced to fight by the insults and demands against us, because of the brutal suppression of ethnic Germans in Poland, and because of the open announcements that they would do everything in their power to strangle National Socialist Germany through military or economic means.

>**What are we fighting for?**

>We are fighting for our most valuable possession: our freedom. We are fighting for our land and our skies. We are fighting so that our children will not be slaves of foreign rulers. That is in no way an exaggeration or empty phrase.

>We know that we will be slaves if we do not win and we know that the goal of [England’s policy of encirclement](https://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/wehr02.htm) is to subject Germany to its will. We know what that means. We all remember the days when Allied inspectors wandered around Germany.

>We are fighting for Germany’s freedom and for Germany’s right to be a people that has all it needs to preserve its national existence. The Führer made unprecedented offers for peace and understanding to those who are now fighting against Germany. His attempts were scornfully rejected because they wanted this fight.

>We are fighting for a lasting peace that will make a repetition of Versailles impossible. For two long decades, it caused an enormous, constantly bleeding wound among the ethnic Germans in the East. We are fighting to save our children from the unbearable threats of the Western democracies, driven by envy and hatred.

worldnews,war,U.S. tells allies it won't join war unless Iran targets Americans,"I speculate what is about to happen will be argued to be the only way to stop an escalation into war.

It is all over the news that the President has left the G7 to return to Washington DC to meet with the National Security Council in the White House Situation Room.

I speculate an ultimatum will be given to Iran to either stand down or evacuate their sites at Fordow and Natanz, especially the underground sites.  I speculate the B2 bombers may already be on their way with their bunker buster bombs to finish the matter, from the US perspective, if Iran refuses to back down.

The argument will be that removing Fordow and Natanz from the equation will leave both Israel and Iran with nothing but pointless bombings, drone strikes, and missile exchanges.  There will be no reason to not agree to an immediate ceasefire.

“They started very, very seriously removing the chief of the general staff, in other words like our chairman of the joint chiefs of staff,” she said. “You can imagine what Americans would do.”

On early Friday, multiple Iranian state media outlets reported that General Hossein Salami, the commander-in-chief of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), was killed during Israel’s overnight attacks.

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has confirmed Israel’s strikes struck nuclear targets in Iran and said the operation will continue for many days.

“Moments ago, Israel launched operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel’s very survival,” Netanyahu said in a televised address.

“This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat. For decade the tyrants of Tehran have brazenly, openly, called for Israel’s destruction.”

He said Iran had a program to develop nuclear weapons and claimed it “could produce a nuclear weapon” if not stopped.

“This is a clear and present danger to Israel’s very survival,” Netanyahu said.

“We struck at the head of Iran’s nuclear weaponization program,” he added. “We targeted Iran’s main enrichment facility in Natanz. We targeted Iran’s nuclear scientists working on the Iranian bomb. We also struck at the heart of Iran’s ballistic missiles program”

Netanyahu added: “In defending ourselves, we also defend others. We defend our Arab neighbors. They, too, have suffered from Iran’s campaign of chaos and carnage.”

Iran’s government has not yet commented on the strikes.

worldnews,iran,2025 Israel-Iran Conflict,"**Explosions heard in Natanz, home to key nuclear site, says Iranian state television**

Blasts were heard in Natanz city in Iran’s central province of Isfahan, where a key nuclear site is located, Iranian state TV reports.

“Loud explosions were heard in Natanz,” which hosts one of the main uranium enrichment facilities, state TV reports.

Iran has two underground nuclear sites, at Fordo and Natanz, and has been building tunnels in the mountains near Natanz since suspected Israeli sabotage attacks targeted that facility.

A complex at the heart of Iran’s enrichment program on a plain abutting mountains outside the Shi’ite Muslim holy city of Qom, south of Tehran. Natanz houses facilities including two enrichment plants: the vast, underground Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP) and the above-ground Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant (PFEP).

An exiled Iranian opposition group revealed in 2002 that Iran was secretly building Natanz, igniting the diplomatic standoff between the West and Iran over its nuclear intentions.


The FEP was built for enrichment on a commercial scale, able to house 50,000 centrifuges. Around 14,000 centrifuges are currently installed there, roughly 11,000 of which are in operation, refining uranium to up to 5% purity.

Diplomats with knowledge of Natanz describe the FEP as being about three floors below ground. There has long been debate about how much damage Israeli airstrikes could do to it.

Damage has been done to centrifuges at the FEP by other means, including an explosion and power cut in April 2021 that Iran said was an attack by Israel.

The above-ground PFEP houses only a few hundred centrifuges, but Iran is enriching to up to 60% purity there.

President Donald Trump and senior White House officials were expecting the Israeli strikes on Iran Thursday night, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.

Earlier today, Trump was asked what the Israelis told him to prompt the departure of US personnel from the region. Trump replied: “They didn’t tell me anything, but I said look, there’s a chance of massive conflict.”

Behind the scenes, the sources said, his closest advisers were preparing for the strikes.

Israel has banned schools, social gatherings and non-essential work as it braces for retaliation, following its strikes on Iran.

Siren sounded across Jerusalem as a state of emergency was declared in the country, CNN’s Jerusalem Bureau Chief Oren Liebermann told Anderson Cooper.

Residents received alerts on their cell phones saying the Home Front Command is putting the country on alert, Liebermann said.

The Israel Defense Forces announced changes to the country’s Home Front Command Defensive Guidelines, shifting all areas of the country from “full activity” to “essential activity” at 03:00 a.m. local time.

The guidelines prohibit educational activities, gatherings and workplaces, except for essential sectors, Liebermann said.

worldnews,iran,2025 Israel-Iran Conflict,"**Strikes aimed at addressing three components of the Iranian threat, Israeli military official says**

Israel’s strikes on Iran are aimed at addressing three components of the Iranian threat, an Israeli military official said during a press briefing early Friday. The most important and urgent component is what the official described as “the nuclear trigger.”

“Today, Iran is closer than ever to obtaining a nuclear weapon,” the official said. “Weapons of mass destruction in the hands of the Iranian regime are an existential threat to the State of Israel and a significant threat to the wider world.”

The official cited International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reports that detailed the advance of the Iranian nuclear project, that goes beyond civilian use.

“We are exposing for the first time that the Iranian regime has been advancing a secret program to assemble a nuclear weapon,” the official said, adding that Iran has enough fissile material to create 15 nuclear bombs within days.

The second component of the threat is Iran’s thousands of ballistic missiles, which it plans to double and eventually triple, the official said. “We’re talking about a number of missiles that, even without a nuclear weapon, represents an existential threat,” the official added.

The third component lies in Iran’s distribution of weapons and arms to regional proxies to be used against Israel, the official said.

Considering Iran couldn’t even get their fighters off the ground, my prediction is another token missile salvo, followed by a prolonged terrorist campaign against Israel and the US.

He is tactfully allowing them some extra time to negotiate a less deadly off-ramp than what they would likely receive if they keep bombing Israel, while also allowing more time to get US military assets moved into strategic positions.

If or when he gives the order to strike, the theocratic regime in Iran would be wiped out and blown away to smithereens in probably less than 72 hours.

worldnews,iran,G7 leaders: ‘Iran can never have a nuclear weapon’,"To address the ""it's not fair argument"" and ""every country has a right to nuclear weapons if they wish""

If, for example, the Taliban in Afghanistan started pursuing a nuclear weapons program tomorrow then more than a few countries would be concerned. Not just Western nations. And if the Taliban started to get close to weaponisation, then we might find certain countries would step in and face the consequences of stopping that program - rather than much higher potential consequences of not stopping it.

In the case of Israel, whether or not someone supports them - it's a relatively tiny nation, high density, surrounded by many enemies who have made numerous attempts over the decades to wipe them out. Just a few WMD weapons falling into the wrong hands could cause very significant damage to Israel. As such Israel are highly sensitive to such threats, and there are a long line of fundamentalists who, let's not kid ourselves, would have no problem using WMD on Israel. On the flipside, Israel are nuclear armed, powerful, and backed by a superpower. And as such if they can do something, anything to stop the risk of that happening - they will. Which is why they have struck sites in Iraq, Syria and now Iran. They don't care about world opinion. They will take the bad optics and fallout of looking like aggressors but they will target any program they deem could be used against them.

As such they have a doctrine that Iran will never get nuclear weapons. It's not ""fair"", but that's the reality. Iran have stated that their program is peaceful, and that's fine, but there are signs that it isn't - if they want to go down that road and play those games, then indeed there are consequences.

>This “golden information” was presented by intelligence officials to the political leadership before the decision was made to carry out preemptive strikes Friday, along with the concern that Israel didn’t know everything and that Tehran could be at an even more advanced stage in building a nuclear bomb than the available information showed, Army Radio reported, citing unnamed security officials.

>According to the report, Iran gathered scientists and split them into several working groups to labor in secret on components of the process of weaponizing nuclear material into an actual explosive device, beginning around the end of 2023 or the start of 2024 — shortly after Hamas’s October 7 onslaught, which sparked the ongoing war in Gaza.

>This aspect of designing a nuclear device ran in parallel to Iran’s enrichment of uranium to levels that have no use for civilian purposes, but are required to build a nuclear bomb. According to an International Atomic Energy Agency report at the end of May, Iran’s stockpile of uranium, if enriched further, was enough to build nine nuclear weapons.

>The Israel Defense Forces managed to monitor the secret weapons process, which left Jerusalem with no doubt that Iran had decided to build a nuclear weapon after the massacre in southern Israel, Army Radio said.",1987,2025-06-15 10:23:10,2454,https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-found-iran-carried-out-key-tests-for-nuke-design-ahead-of-strikes-report/,NEUTRAL,0.0

I don't know what's worse, the possibility that the US national intelligence is unable to properly monitor potential nuclear threats from an adversarial nation, or the possibility of Netanyahu lying his way into getting the US entangled in another the Middle Eastern war.

.

70 years ago, Iran looked just like any Western country.

Short skirts, rock'n'roll, open universities.

It's 1953. Iran elects a secular socialist: Mohammad Mossadegh.

He nationalizes oil. That pisses off BP.

Cold War excuse.

CIA and MI6 stage a coup. Operation Ajax.

Mossadegh is overthrown.

They install the Shah, a brutal US-backed dictator.

Secret police. Torture chambers.

Iran turns into a puppet state.

People are that desperate, they turn to Khomeini, an exiled cleric, promising independence and dignity.

1979: Islamic Revolution.

The Shah flees.

US embassy stormed. Hostage crisis.

America never forgives.

Arms Saddam Hussein.

Iraq invades Iran.

US provides chemical weapons, satellite intel, logistics.

1 million Iranians die.

Iranian kids sent into minefields with plastic keys around their necks.

US shoots down Iran Air Flight 655

290 civilians dead.

No apology.

Fast forward today, Israel attacks Iran.

The U.S. immediately says ""we stand with Israel.""

They talk about ""regime change.""

They say that Iranians ""deserve freedom.""

No mention of the coup they started.

No mention of the dictator they installed.

No mention of the war they fueled.

No mention of the decades of sanctions and sabotage.

They created the monster, and now act shocked it's still breathing.",218,2025-06-15 12:30:37,2454,https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-found-iran-carried-out-key-tests-for-nuke-design-ahead-of-strikes-report/,NEGATIVE,-0.9174759984016418

Back in 2010, there was a whole genre of Ruzzian pulp fiction where people from Russia travel back in time and beat the fuck out of the ""enemies"" of Russia to make their country the dominant power. Think like Army of Darkness but instead its Dmitri Ivanovich instead of the American Dude in the Movie.

  
One of the most popular subjects in that genre is nuking or otherwise obliterating 15th or 16th century London. As the Fiction basically claims that since the United States originates from ""England"", go back far enough in time and you can erase both.

  
So for the Russians, nuking London is like some HOI4 wet dream that is too darn prominent in the minds of too many people.

Defensive versus offensive.

They need to put it out there because it's part of the manipulation.  But they'll avoid bringing any attention to the part of it they don't want you to know while leaving little justifications for the future plans.

This is when they are the most manipulative. They're putting on their sheep's clothing and they will suddenly take a stance that is uncharacteristic to get the first step past people's defenses with their plausible deniability.  There's always a second shoe to drop

Read between the lines.  Take note of what he doesn't want you to take note of. 


In this instance, Trump is speaking several steps ahead.  Laying out the groundwork justification.  It's plotting, not reactive

The uncharacteristic part: portraying Putin as a villain and threatening sanctions he's previously decried.

And when they don't, because they've been very clear about that, he'll use it as an excuse to pull all American support from the side he's setting the stage to portray as the problem.

- Russia will demand to keep Crimea and the Donetsk region.

- Ukraine will refuse. 

- United States will drop support because they refuse to pay for a war Ukraine is continuing 

- Russia will simultaneously make accusations/threats against other NATO nations in order to discourage those countries from reinforcing their support as the United States withdraws

- Russia will make another attempt at Odessa while ramping up the war crimes 

- they will attempt to replace the demographics in the area to suppress resistance.  They will engage in genocide of every variety.  Kidnapping, rape, etc.  It's their M.O.

worldnews,nuke,NATO Military Chief Says Troops Would Be on Ground if Not for Russian Nukes,"NATO troops would be on the ground in Ukraine fighting Russian forces if Moscow did not have nuclear weapons, the head of the alliance’s military committee has said

“I am absolutely sure if the Russians did not have nuclear weapons, we would have been in Ukraine, kicking them out,” Admiral Rob Bauer, the outgoing chief of NATO’s Military Committee, said during an appearance at the IISS Prague Defence Summit in the Czech Republic on Sunday.

Russia has the world’s largest stockpile of nuclear weapons, followed closely by the U.S.’ nuclear arsenal. Combined, Moscow and Washington control around 90 percent of the nuclear weapons across the globe.

NATO troops being committed to the fight on Ukraine’s behalf has largely been off the table, although foreign fighters have joined Ukraine’s military as volunteers.

In February, French President Emmanuel Macron refused to rule out sending Western soldiers. The remarks were quickly downplayed by other NATO countries, and then-secretary general of the alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, said it was not considering sending troops to the battlefield. U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently said there would be no U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine.

The alliance has said it supports Ukraine, but that it is not directly involved in the conflict. NATO countries, which spent years in Afghanistan and in Iraq shortly after the turn of the century, are very reluctant to broach the subject of deploying their own ground troops in Ukraine. Kyiv has said it has not asked its supporters for troops, only military aid.

“If you fight in Afghanistan, that’s not the same as fighting the Russians in Ukraine,” because the Taliban did not have nuclear weapons, Bauer said. “There is a big difference between Afghanistan and Ukraine.”",414,2024-11-10 20:53:59,1141,https://www.newsweek.com/nato-russia-nuclear-weapons-ukraine-ground-troops-rob-bauer-1983425,NEUTRAL,0.0

>France’s nuclear arsenal could indeed help protect Poland, Polish President Andrzej Duda said in remarks published Friday.

>Duda, who has called for Poland to host some of the United States’ nuclear weapons on its soil to deter Russian aggression, said French warheads could also bolster Polish defenses.

>“I believe we can accept both solutions,” the president told Bloomberg in an interview in Warsaw. “These two ideas are neither contradictory nor mutually exclusive.”

>French President Emmanuel Macron has suggested extending France’s so-called nuclear umbrella over its European allies, amid fears an aggressive Russia could one day turn its sights from Ukraine, which it invaded in 2014 and again in 2022, to the European Union’s eastern flank.

>With around 300 nuclear warheads, France is the only EU member country to possess such weapons, and one of three NATO members along with the U.S. and the U.K.

>Poland and Denmark have previously expressed openness to the idea of sheltering under France’s nuclear protection. In March, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk — who comes from a rival party to Duda — said Poland was “talking seriously"" with France about the possibility, which has gained traction after warnings from the U.S. that Donald Trump's White House may not provide security guarantees to Europe in the future.

Here's the thing: he's a compete moron. Everything he wants to do is utter nonsense at best and economic suicide at worst. He's too incoherent to even be a con man, all the scams that earned him money were not coordinated by him. He spent HALF A CENTURY making absolutely transparent that anything he's capable of doing with a business is crashing it to the ground while syphoning all the cash into lavish and gaudy garbage.

He's the only man that started a multi millionaire, loaned and  evaded taxes for HALF A BILLION USD, invested the most stable and lucrative market of the century (real estates) and, accounting inflation, didn't make actual money over his whole life. His highest pride is his brand, which business's plan is (*drumroll*)... selling cheap crap at astronomical prices by posing them as luxury stuff. Too bad that the actual rich people find that stuff posh and disgusting, while those that like them are the uneducated poors (because that don't know what quality stuff looks like). To put it simply, his business plan is trying to sell expensive, horrible garbage to those who cannot buy them even if they liked them.


He doesn't understand business planning. He doesn't understand money management. He doesn't even understand basic economic fundamentals like offer and demand. Hell, he probably doesn't even understand elementary school math. He's a narcissist that has repeatedly proven that he'll do exactly what he says and what he says is absolute economic and diplomatic suicide. Every sane person knew and pointed out that even only on the economic side, Trump II would have been a disaster.


AND YET millions of people tough to invest into him and his economic plan.

Although, now that you’re moving into a more imperial style presidency America, maybe you need to learn from people who knew how to deal with royal favorites. Here’s a few examples for you: 

Piers Gaveston (d. 1312) – Favorite of Edward II of England
Piers Gaveston was the intimate companion (and possibly lover) of Edward II, who showered him with titles and wealth. His arrogance and open contempt for the English nobility, including calling them by insulting nicknames, made him a prime target for their wrath. After repeated exiles and returns, a group of barons captured him, put him through a sham trial, and executed him—reportedly by stabbing him through the heart and beheading him.

Robert Cochrane (d. 1482) – Favorite of James III of Scotland
Cochrane rose to become James III’s chief advisor, earning the nobility’s scorn for his low birth and the king’s preference for him over traditional Scottish lords. During a rebellion against James III, Scottish nobles hanged Cochrane from Lauder Bridge along with other royal favorites, supposedly using a crude rope made from horse tack.

George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham (assassinated in 1628) – Favorite of James I and Charles I of England
Buckingham was extraordinarily close to both James I and his son Charles I, accumulating immense power. His failed military campaigns, monopolization of royal favor, and extravagant lifestyle made him deeply resented. He was stabbed to death by a disgruntled army officer, John Felton, who believed Buckingham had betrayed England through his military incompetence. Felton was hailed as a hero by many.",2,2025-03-21 05:32:34,1156,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/us/politics/musk-pentagon-briefing-china-war-plan.html?unlocked_article_code=1.5k4.SRAZ.aIZGK_LvUkAE&smid=nytcore-android-share,NEGATIVE,-0.6455051898956299

Edit 2: Israel is a proxy for US force in the Middle East. US taxes provide massive amounts of funding for an attack like this.

There are still technical problems with some details in the fuel cycle, but thorium represents a great potential solution to our carbon-intensive energy problem.

They control pretty much every level of government in the majority of states and at the federal level. Dems are a true failed party at the national level.

It is just a distraction. Neither Tucker Carlson or Ted Cruz are part of the administration. Cruz is a high profile Republican but not currently in leadership. Cruz can shop taking points and wrestle a bit (with a friendly media source)  ways to sell a justification for war without it impacting the governments official position. If Marco Rubio had the same conversation it would reflect on official policy because Rubio is Sec of State. Cruz is nothing. 

Cruz, MTG, Graham, and other Republicans that are disconnected from the Cabinet will flood the zone with various arguments for and against bombing Iran. None of those arguments being official. Then the Administration with coalesce around which ever ones work day to day. Cruz is arguing with Tucker to create the appearance of Republicans having a substantive debate and position on Iran. 

It is just cover to obscure from that fact that no one knows what is happening. The conditions in Iran appear to be the same as they've been for 15yrs. Netanyahu has been saying Iran was weeks away from a nuclear weapon for decades. Why Israel has pulled the trigger and Trump appears ready jump in too isn't clear at the moment. Cruz and Tucker are just stalling until Trump does whatever it is Trump will do. 

If Trump stands down Tucker will applaud Trump for his cool headedness and Cruz will just go back to being quiet. If Trump bombs Iran Cruz will applaud and Tucker will become quiet.

politics,war,The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans,"This is absolutely staggering. I’m still trying to process the fact that senior U.S. officials—people at the highest levels of government—were casually texting war plans over Signal, an app that’s not even approved for classified communications. Not only that, but they accidentally added a journalist to the group chat. And then? Just carried on like nothing happened. No one noticed. No one asked questions. They dropped operational details, discussed strategy, named targets, and then capped it all off with high-five emojis.

It’s not just irresponsible—it’s surreal. This isn’t a parody or a leaked TV script. This happened. They talked about military strikes the same way people coordinate a fantasy football draft. And then, as if to hammer home just how broken our national security culture has become, they celebrated the bombing of a foreign country with emojis. Fire, flags, praying hands, muscle arms. Like they’d just won a pickup basketball game.

What’s worse—what really makes my blood boil—is that nothing will come of it. Nothing. There won’t be hearings. No one will be fired. There won’t even be a slap on the wrist. The fact that a sitting Secretary of Defense might have violated the Espionage Act by leaking sensitive war plans over an unsecured app to a journalist should be a full-blown national scandal. Instead? Silence. Shrugs. Maybe a Fox News segment praising how ""tough"" the response was.

It’s the normalization of absurdity. It’s government by group chat, with the fate of lives—American and otherwise—being tossed around like a Twitter thread. And the most horrifying part? They all seem to think this is fine. Routine. Standard operating procedure.

This is bigger than partisan politics. This is about the breakdown of basic standards—of competence, of professionalism, of decency. If this doesn’t trigger national outrage, if this doesn’t result in real consequences, then we’ve officially accepted that chaos, recklessness, and emoji warfare are the new norm.

> The account labeled ""JD Vance"" responded at 8:16: ""Team, I am out for the day doing an economic event in Michigan. But I think we are making a mistake."" (Vance was indeed in Michigan that day.) The Vance account goes on to state, ""3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does.
There is a real risk that the public doesn't understand this or why it's necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.""

Propagandalf to the rescue 

>The Vance account then goes on to make a noteworthy statement, considering that the vice president has not deviated publicly from Trump's position on virtually any issue. ""I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. Theres a further risk that we see a that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.""

Messaging, not minimizing human lives, is the upmost of importance

>The account identified as ""JD Vance"" addressed a message at 8:45 to @Pete Hegseth: ""if you think we should do it let's go. I just hate bailing Europe out again."" (The administration has argued that America's European allies benefit economically from the U.S. Navy's protection of international shipping.  

Who will think of the white knights who always are so selfless.

>The user identified as Hegseth responded three minutes later: ""VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC. 

The audacity to call anyone free loaders. 

>And if there are things we can do upfront to minimize risk to Saudi oil facilities we should do it.
Propagandalf is on the case!

>Several former U.S. officials told Harris and me that they had used Signal to share unclassified information and to discuss routine matters, particularly when traveling overseas without access to U.S. government systems.

>But they knew never to share classified or sensitive information on the app, because their phones could have been hacked by a foreign intelligence service, which would have been able to read the messages on the devices. It is worth noting that Donald Trump, as a candidate for president (and as president), repeatedly and vociferously demanded that Hillary Clinton be imprisoned for using a private email server for official business when she was secretary of state. (It is also worth noting that Trump was indicted in 2023 for mishandling classified documents, but the charges were dropped after his election.)

2002 AUMF: Authorizes action in Iraq, sometimes used to justify unrelated strikes.

...

As a reminder, there have been two previous preemptive strikes on nascent nuclear programs: Iraq in 1981 and Syria in 2007. In each case, people claimed this would only encourage the countries to scramble for a bomb. In each case the intelligence was questioned (famously Bush refused to join the 2007 strike due to the US IC assigning low probability to the Israeli assessment).

Imagine a world with a nuclear Iraq invading Kuwait, or a nuclear Syria beset by civil war. And imagine a nuclear Iran, able to continue spreading its poison across the Middle East through Hamas, Hezbollah, the houthis…

Nonproliferation is nonnegotiable. Almost any cost is worth bearing to avoid the decades of pain that allowing just one unstable nation to develop nukes entails, not to mention the likely ripple effect leading to neighbors also going nuclear.

A little insight on American War

The War Powers Resolution was enacted in 1973.  It placed a 60 day limit on military deployments initiated by the President without a declaration of war or specific congressional authorization. 

Who has used this…well

President Regan used the 60 day window during the “Tanker War” in the Persian Gulf

President Clinton faced challenges related to troop deployments in the former Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Kosovo

President Obama deployed troops to Libya without explicit Congressional Authorization and Congress deferred to act in Syria 

So Trump informed Speaker Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Thune, as prescribed by law.

An expert at the Federation of American Scientists warned that ""radioactive fallout would be intense"" if the U.S. deployed a penetrator nuke.

This clip from *The Dead Zone* went viral back in 2015 when the orange disaster first slithered down his tacky, gold-plated Trump Tower escalator, announcing his intent to be crowned the next president by his network of corrupt cronies in the GOP and Kremlin aka, his ""candidacy.""

Fast forward to today, and less than 200 days into his illegitimate presidency, it’s clear this prescient clip is due for a revival. Some things never change, like the fact that Trump is *still* a puppet of foreign powers and the figurehead for the GOP criminal syndicate that has poisoned the soul of this nation.   Enjoy the déjà vu.

While only Congress has the power to formally ""declare war,"" many U.S. presidents have ordered military actions in other countries without a specific congressional declaration of war. This has been a long-standing point of debate regarding the constitutional powers of the executive and legislative branches.

Some notable examples of presidents who have ordered military attacks without a formal declaration of war include:

* **Harry Truman:** Sent U.S. forces into combat in Korea in 1950, which he characterized as a ""police action"" under the United Nations.
* **Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon:** Committed U.S. troops to Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War without a declaration of war. This led to the passage of the War Powers Resolution in 1973, intended to limit presidential authority in such situations.
* **Ronald Reagan:** Ordered the use of military force in various places, including Libya, Grenada, and Lebanon.
* **George H.W. Bush:** Directed an invasion of Panama to topple the government of Manuel Noriega. He also deployed troops to Kuwait in 1990, arguing he had the right to do so even without congressional approval, though Congress ultimately authorized the use of force for Operation Desert Storm.
* **Bill Clinton:** Ordered military actions in places like Bosnia and Kosovo (e.g., the bombing of Kosovo in 1999).
* **George W. Bush:** Ordered military action in Afghanistan and Iraq following the September 11th attacks, operating under Authorizations for the Use of Military Force (AUMFs) passed by Congress.
* **Barack Obama:** Ordered a military intervention in Libya in 2011 without seeking congressional approval, arguing it did not fall under the War Powers Resolution. He also authorized air strikes against the Islamic State in 2014, citing the 2002 AUMF.
* **Donald Trump:** Ordered missile strikes against Syria in 2017 after a chemical warfare attack, and a drone strike that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in 2020.
* **Joe Biden:** Has cited AUMFs and Article II powers for military actions against Iran-backed militant groups in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and the Red Sea.

The War Powers Resolution of 1973 attempts to define and limit the President's power to commit U.S. forces to hostilities without congressional consent, requiring notification to Congress within 48 hours and setting a 60-day limit on deployments without congressional authorization. However, presidents have often interpreted their constitutional powers as Commander-in-Chief broadly, leading to ongoing debates and controversies over military actions abroad.",2,2025-06-22 06:33:10,1237,https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5362332-massie-on-u-s-bombs-against-iran-this-is-not-constitutional/,NEUTRAL,0.0

Trump: I want to bomb Iran.

And even when the officer can't say yes, there's an environment in the military that when the boss (someone who outranks you) asks for something you find ways to get to yes. 

So Trump being advised by a bunch of guys who will try and do what he asks, no matter how improbable, is exactly what he would like.

edit: maga forgot Putin put Trump in office in 2016 to help reclaim Ukraine. Putin forgot he can't win a war by pushing his own people out of high rise windows.

A quote from 2 years after Trump's terror attack on the capital: 

>“I went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, ‘This is genius.’ Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine — of Ukraine — Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that’s wonderful,” Trump said in a radio interview with “The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show.” “He used the word ‘independent’ and ‘we’re gonna go out and we’re gonna go in and we’re gonna help keep peace.’ You gotta say that’s pretty savvy.”

politics,nuke,Graham: Israel Should Do ‘Whatever’ They Want to Palestinians Like When U.S. Nuked Japan,"Okay, so, checks notes, the GOP is now okay with nuclear war and genocide. 

The party of ""no"" sure is a party of ""yes"" when it comes to batshit-crazy, huh?

> When moderator Kristen Welker pointed out to Graham that Republican former President Ronald Reagan withheld weapons shipments to Israel in the 1980s during its conflict with Lebanon, Graham returned to World War II.

Reagan used his power to influence Israeli war policy multiple times. 

Indeed, there were several instances where Reagan ordered warplanes and munitions to be delayed because they were going to be used against civilians and in ways America did not approve. 

And reportedly, the civilian casualties - particularly during the 1982 Lebanon War and when Israel attacked PLO targets - bothered him greatly and he found it deeply upsetting. Even writing of his disgust and the need to influence Israel in his diary.

For Reagan, the civilian casualties were an impetus for action as much as any other political reasons.

And Reagan wasn't the only Republican to play hardball with Israel...

Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened economic sanctions and an aid cutoff to force Israel to withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula after it invaded Egypt in 1956.

politics,nuke,Graham: Israel Should Do ‘Whatever’ They Want to Palestinians Like When U.S. Nuked Japan,"The US rebuilt Japan AND Germany after WWII.   

It was not pure altruism - the Allies had left Post WWI Germany to itself and the economic ruin of it helped pave the way for Hitler's rise.  It's been known and accepted for a century that you don't destroy civil infrastructure and leave a population with no hope for the future.  You just don't.  It's a formula for endless suffering and conflict.  It's why the US spent so long in Iraq and Afghanistan, although they largely failed there to establish new infrastructure due to other factors.

The result with Germany and Japan, though, was incredibly strong economies that have been prospering for the last 70+ years with no major conflicts (the Cold War aside, it wasn't specifically about them). 

In any case, I doubt Graham is arguing that Israel should rebuild Palestine and help usher in an era of peace and prosperity.

  
Some sources on Post WWII reconstruction:

>A similar history applies to Japan. American forces **occupied** Japan until 1951. American taxpayers covered the costs, and the United States financed much of the domestic reconstruction of the country. Scholars estimate that between 1946 and 1951 the United States contributed more than $2 billion to rebuild schools, factories, and other institutions that the war destroyed.

>[https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/cost-victory](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/cost-victory)



>The early post-war years were devoted to rebuilding lost industrial capacity: major investments were made in electric power, coal, steel, and chemicals. By the mid-1950s, production matched prewar levels. Released from the demands of military-dominated government, the economy not only recovered its lost momentum but also surpassed the growth rates of earlier periods. Between 1953 and 1965, GDP expanded by more than 9% per year, manufacturing and mining by 13%, construction by 11%, and infrastructure by 12%. In 1965 these sectors employed more than 41% of the labor force, whereas only 26% remained in agriculture.[^(\[5\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postwar_Japan#cite_note-5)

>Japan's highly acclaimed post-war [education system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Japan) contributed strongly to the modernizing process. The world's highest literacy rate and high education standards were major reasons for Japan's success in achieving a technologically advanced economy. Japanese schools also encouraged discipline, another benefit in forming an effective work force.
