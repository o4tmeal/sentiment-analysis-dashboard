But that would require political and economically minded people to come forward and guide the country. We’ll be spiraling for years either way. Our education system needs to be dismantled and reworked as well. It was designed by Rockefeller to create factory workers and cogs in their capitalistic wheel not about really educating people.

Center for Global Development estimates that USAIDsaves 2.3 million to 5.6 million lives per year.  From 2001 to 2021 it is estimate that USAID prevented over 90 million deaths, with the biggest impact  in preventing deaths from tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria. Trump gutted the program.

He's demonstrated that he doesn't value the lives of immigrants or legal citizens with darker skin. He's willing to lock them up or ship them to a concentration camp. Every day new stories emerge of the injustices....old people who have raised military members, immigrants doing backbreaking work in our fields, young children suffering from terminal cancer, shipped away as a death sentence.

Trump doesn't understand the sacrifice of soldiers (aka ""suckers"") who died for our freedom. Why would he give a second thought about  starting a war in Mexico. He won't care how many people he kills, including US soldiers.

Additionally, he’s stupid if he thinks Latin America wouldn’t just immediately turn to China and Russia as primary trade partners because of this, waving the U.S.’ influence on our southern neighbors. 

Remember when a seemingly useless little Caribbean island 90 miles off the coast of the U.S. scared the fuck out of America for decades because they aligned with the USSR and hosted nukes? Yeah.

If Japan raises interest rates to save their economy from inevitable hyper-inflation, our borrowers cant afford to repay them for all the yen they borrowed near or at 0%. Those same borrowers are over-leveraged here to the tune of no less than 34:1. Many of those borrowers are also Wall Street's biggest players, and are engaged in all sorts of Grey-at-best activity. It only takes one domino to fall and the entire house of cards they've erected toppled.

So what would a mindless, spineless coward hack do to save us? He would lazily wear the 1 shoe that fits all and take a replicate conditions he's seen economies recover from in our past history. 

#1 hedge his own assets against the collapsing dollar with crypto. Inventing his own shitcoin was his little touch. Thanks Eric and Baron!

#2 HE thinks tariffs were a major factor in saving us from the Great Depression- (which is what economists warn our fate may be worse than.) He forgets about the Dust Bowl, but he can barely read so whatever... he read the foot notes, and farmers are fucked.

#3 He saw FDR turn things around by gearing up for WW2. Now all we need is to get on the winning side of a good ol American war. Russia/Ukraine is too flippy floppy, but hes now leaning BACK to Putin. We could also just play it safe and just invade a country like Greenland, Canada or... Mexico.

I'm sure Canadians don't want to wake up one day and for Russia to to be like surprise we said we were shipping over our own mining equipment but this whole time it was armaments now we're going to help the US take over Canada.

Instigating shit and interfering in Brazil. 

The Panama canal business.. 

Making relationships with El Salvador etc
I mean it's possible it's all just tangentially related, but it's also possible that it's part of a bigger push to exert more power over the Americas ultimately invading sovereign Nations.

And then of course Ukraine and all of NATO stuff in Europe is a gift to Russia.. 

I can't help but think it's all connected.

Yes. This has a been a work in progress for Trump/GOP since Trump's first term and was being planned out during Biden's term. And since it's been years in the making, yes this is serious. 

------

First term Trump wanted to [shoot patriot missiles into Mexico and deny it was the US](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/us/politics/mark-esper-book-trump.html) according to his defense secretary Mark Esper. Trump asked him about it twice! Then the elected GOP agreed and started to prepare both rhetorically and began to write up authorization for Trump to do so.

[March 2023:](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/comer-says-was-mistake-trump-didnt-bomb-drug-labs-mexico-rcna73930) **Comer says it was a 'mistake' that Trump didn't bomb drug labs in Mexico**

> House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., on Tuesday said it was “a mistake” that then-President Donald Trump did not bomb meth labs in Mexico after he had reportedly asked his defense secretary about the possibility in 2020.

> Trump and his MAGAfied Republican Party are pushing plans for military action against drug cartels in Mexico — with or without the Mexican government's consent

> Republicans suggest everything from terrorist labels to an invasion to decimate drug cartels in Mexico.

[Oct 2023:](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/03/us/politics/trump-mexico-cartels-republican.html) **Trump Wanted to Fire Missiles at Mexico. Now the G.O.P. Wants to Send Troops.**

> The Republican push to use military force in Mexico against drug cartels started in the Trump White House. He has plans to make the idea a reality in 2025.

> On Capitol Hill, Republican lawmakers have drafted a broad authorization for the use of military force against cartels — echoing the war powers Congress gave former President George W. Bush before the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. They have also pushed for designating Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organizations — a related idea Mr. Trump flirted with as president but backed off after Mexico hotly objected. Now, if Mr. Trump returns to the White House in 2025, he has vowed to push for the designations and to deploy Special Operations troops and naval forces to, as he put it, declare war on the cartels.

politics,oil,Democrats unveil plan to issue quarterly checks to Americans by taxing oil companies posting huge profits,"The price of gas is based on the market price of oil, which is traded in the global marketplace. Domestically, we (had) a series of policies that encouraged domestic production of energy and energy friendly policies which resulted in low prices of oil and gas products.

Covid aside, we had policies that were friendly to the blood that is necessary to operate the American body. 

When the new administration took over, they not only signaled they were actively hostile towards domestic oil and gas, but put in place policies that killed some existing and future domestic oil & gas production and the ease of movement of fossil fuel products through America. 

This was taken by the oil companies and the banks that financed their capital expenditures that the ""new"" domestic energy agenda was to be wrapped up in forcing ""clean"" energy initiatives and accelerating the transition to alternative, non-fossil fuel forms of energy. 

The result is that oil companies, drillers and explorers spent less on Capex among other things. 

Now that the Biden admin is in a political nightmare with inflation via high energy costs, they have tried to extend an olive branch to big oil. But big oil will say, either you explicitly reverse the disastrous policies that have largely contributed to this mess, or fuck you. 

They made their bed for their climate agenda and they are now laying in it (unfortunately for us). 

They made a gamble. Their bet was that global energy prices would remain relatively low enough and stable for their green energy policies, credits, etc to catch. They calculated horribly wrong (given that they knew that inflation and energy prices would increase post COVID hysteria) and then, they just got black swan'ed on top of it via Russia v Ukraine. 

The sensible approach would have been just put an impossible to pass bill with some the things he put through executive order attached to radical stuff, take your lumps and say ""we gave it the old college try"", blame it on Manchin and not fuck up a good thing while quietly stuffing piecemeal their green energy policies slowly into other bills. Instead, they played politics to score points with their base and more radical factions of the Democrat party. 

I have also seen comments like, ""just fucking lower the cost of gas."" You can't do this via back door price controls, (aka basically the idea in this article) because that may temporarily work in the very short term, but will ultimately make the situation way worse in the intermediate and long term. 

This is a disaster we haven't seen in 40 years. In this scenario, the Biden energy policies can be equated to the meme of the guy on a bike putting a stick in the spokes. 

If they continue to deflect, blame Putin, Covid and any other excuses they can throw at the wall and not actually concede, reverse course and address the issues of suppliers of the product they need have levied, this will only get worse. 

My bet is that if he just admits that he was wrong, reverse course and actually ""do all that I can to lower gas prices"", he will see a bump in his poll numbers. Admitting your policies were wrong may be suicide in Washington, DC but for the good majority of Americans, conceding and changing course when action is needed, is viewed as leadership and we need alot of it now.",5,2022-03-11 03:54:00,4309,https://www.businessinsider.com/dems-plan-checks-americans-tax-oil-companies-profits-2022-3,NEGATIVE,-0.67026287317276

politics,oil,Democrats unveil plan to issue quarterly checks to Americans by taxing oil companies posting huge profits,"This is fucking stupid and it’s going to make the democrats look so bad. $240 a year? Are you kidding me? How many tanks of gas does that get you? I’m a leftist and I hate when democrats try doing stupid shit like this. Real socialist programs can be very effective and helpful - NOT taxing a huge industry while prices are already insanely high to get people enough money to buy 4 more tanks of gas. If this somehow gets passed and gas prices even slightly increase at any point afterwards? Forget it, we’ll never fucking hear the end of it. On top of that, imagine what other industries will do to take advantage of this. Would this taxation cause a price increase in gas? Let’s hope not, or the grocery stores will complain about “increased shipping costs” while artificially raising the cost of groceries well beyond what is needed to actually compensate for the increased cost. They’re already doing this now from COVID. 

Now, if this was done as part of a larger scale effort, like taxing oil, big tech, big pharma, etc and redistributing that wealth to the Americans below the poverty line/use it to build homes for the homeless/help fund Medicare for all, that would be a different story. But $240 a year? The right is going to have a field day with this. Classic Democrat bullshit where they act like they’re fighting for the working class when really they just want to virtue signal. Can’t believe this is the most “progressive” party in our country and their solution to rising gas prices is potentially giving people $240 a year after major taxation. 

The working class in this country is in need of serious help, and this won’t do shit. We got through a pandemic and still don’t have single payer healthcare, we worked from home and made historic wealth increases and yet are still being urged by companies and the fucking POTUS to return to office, POTUS promised to cancel student debt and doesn’t even bring it up at the SOTU, the list goes on. It’s a shit show, the people in power don’t give a fuck about any of us. None of this helps build a case for the democrats and it’s unfortunately just fueling more Trump support.
