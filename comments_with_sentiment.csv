politics,china,"China cancels 12,000 metric tons of US pork shipments","From the article:

China canceled 12,000 metric tons of United States pork shipments amid a high-stakes trade standoff between the superpowers, according to data released Thursday. 

China, one of the biggest U.S. trading partners, axed 12,000 metric tons of U.S. pork orders, the data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) shows.

China, behind Mexico and Japan, was the U.S.’s third-biggest market for pork in 2024, importing some 475,000 metric tons valued at more than $1.1 billion. 

China is the world’s biggest producer of pork, accounting for nearly 50 percent of global supply at around 57 million metric tons, according to the USDA. The U.S. was ranked third at 11 percent with 12 million metric tons. 

China said Thursday that the U.S. is not engaged in talks to come up with a new trade deal, a characterization that Trump rejected later in the day.",2259,2025-04-24 23:43:35,2752,https://thehill.com/policy/international/5266321-china-cancels-us-pork-ships/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR6D7e3roqKRIakomSeuVRIKrgk7JBxMDTLzVxVKCPvSdLpUzYf3mPo-DZ8B7g_aem_EwPj3iVLLWLTmRMyIaecTQ,NEUTRAL,0.0

politics,china,"China cancels 12,000 metric tons of US pork shipments","I suspect that a lot of the trade entered into by China with the US has been made not on the basis of trade itself but for strategic purposes. 

China has targeted industries for imports not on the basis of it being the best price or due to a supply shortage from other exporting nations. The strong USD makes its exports costly to begin with and shipping across the Pacific adds to this cost.

Now that the US has declared a trade war on China it is now able to retaliate by cancelling orders and sourcing alternatives at a lower cost from economies with weaker currencies and in closer proximity.

Australia is now picking up the trade in newly cancelled US beef exports and LNG due to proximity and exchange rate. It , and other economies , can ramp up production of these and fill the gaps left by the US. China then benefits from lower priced imports.

Part of the insane demands on Australia is for it to buy American beef. Australia it is not only a beef exporting economy but also has restrictions on growth hormone tainted foods. Cancellation of US beef into China now means that Australia can take its place and increase its exports. 

At the same time Australia has gone from a huge pre-tariff trade deficit with the USA to now having a trade surplus due to surging gold exports triggered by demand from nervous investors.

I doubt very much that the US will ever recover this trade even if tariffs are lifted. China will not enter into any trade discussions while tariffs are in place. If they are dropped then I suspect that any discussions with China will have it demanding a free trade agreement.

The US has snookered itself and this trade war was lost before it began.",84,2025-04-25 00:58:06,2752,https://thehill.com/policy/international/5266321-china-cancels-us-pork-ships/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR6D7e3roqKRIakomSeuVRIKrgk7JBxMDTLzVxVKCPvSdLpUzYf3mPo-DZ8B7g_aem_EwPj3iVLLWLTmRMyIaecTQ,NEGATIVE,-0.5764064192771912

politics,china,"China cancels 12,000 metric tons of US pork shipments","I don't think I've ever witnessed a president be so singlehandedly responsible for destabilizing the global economy.

It's also no surprise that Trump is trying desperately to blame these outcomes on anyone or any*thing* else but himself and his own actions and policies.

And policies, mind you, that damn near every economist warned us about. It's not like these were wild predictions either.

Current estimates show that a recession is around the corner, with real GDP growth for the first quarter coming in negative at -2.2 percent.

When Trump caved on his ""liberation day"" tariffs, he claimed that dozens of countries were coming to the negotiating table, when in fact, the current administration is struggling to make deals with these other countries, including Japan, one of our largest trading partners.

And let's be clear here, Trump didn't back down because these other world leaders were ""kissing his ass,"" he backed down because his policies are reckless and ill conceived, while he was likely being pressured by his advisors to pull back on some of these damaging trade policies. And by pressure I mean that his closest allies were probably pleading with Trump the same way a parent does when they're trying to get their child to eat vegetables.

No, these countries aren't kissing Trump's ass, they're being alienated and some are even being forced to take a harsher stance against the U.S. In other words, Trump is welcoming retaliation, which actually has the opposite intended effect when it comes to reducing the trade deficit.

And what's worse is that as Trump continues to escalate economic and diplomatic tensions between us and these other countries, they are being incentivized to turn to China! And believe it or not, China has their collective shit together and can weather the storm a hell of a lot better than we can.

And this has also turned out to be a massive failure because before Trump upended global trade, the US was in a much better position to economically isolate China!

This point needs to be emphasized over and over again. China's economy has expanded and grown at an exponential rate over the years. They have the means, the population, the resources, the bureaucracy, the workforce, etc, to win a trade war against the US nine times out of ten.

Now, keep in mind that Trump has still imposed sweeping tariffs on a wide range of goods, products and services from dozens of countries, while he continues to escalate matters with China one day, but backpedal on his policies the next.

He obviously never learned his lesson from last time. Because not only did Trump start a trade war with China during his first term, which led to harmful consequences for American businesses and consumers, but he also managed to increase the trade deficit at the same time.

But his supporters will tell you that this time it's different, even though he failed to balance the trade deficit last time when our tariff policies weren't as sweeping and haphazard as they are now.

They'll also explain that this is just all ""part of the plan"" to force other countries to start treating the United States ""fairly.""

Yes, the United States—which has spent the last several decades making itself the centerpiece of the current global trade system—is now the victim of the system it helped build in the first place.

I've come to realize that this talking point—which Trump uses to justify his reckless trade policies—is merely a broader representation of the right's insistence that they are being constantly victimized by the powers that be. Except in this case, it's on a global scale.

That being said, none of this has kept Trump's spokespeople from going to bat for him, claiming that he's playing ""3D chess""  while lying to Americans about the long term effectiveness of his ""genius"" policies. ""It's all part of the plan."" What plan? You've shown us that there is no immutable plan here, that there is no certainty or stability whatsoever, and that the current administration is entirely untrustworthy.

This is all while Trump continues to make allies of enemies and enemies of allies as he fails to follow through on his ""day one"" promises.

In fact, it appears that Trump is more interested now in readmitting Russia back into the international club, than he is committed to negotiating a peace between Ukraine and its land grabbing enemy, nay, *our* enemy.

And yes, the flagrant hypocrisy of Trump and his supporters has been on full display these past few months.

Where in the past they used the stock market, CPI data, consumer confidence, price increases, Fed announcements, etc, as major metrics for indicating that a democrat president was doing a terrible job with the economy. But this time around, they're bending over backwards to defend Trump while trying desperately to rationalize why poor economic trends and ominous predictions about where the economy is headed are no big deal.

What's worse is that most of the economic issues we faced under Biden were a direct result of the global pandemic and its reverberating shock on the economy. On the other hand, most of the economic issues we have today are the direct result of one man's actions.

And Trump is such a vindictive, insecure, pretentious idiot that he doesn't realize, nor does he care that his rhetoric and actions are having the opposite intended effect on the economy. He doesn't realize that threatening to fire Jerome Powell will force markets into a tailspin. He's even gone on national TV and admitted that he ""couldn't care less"" if businesses raise their prices!

All those people who claimed they voted for Trump because he's a ""businessman"" don't realize that Trump is indeed running the country like he does his businesses, straight into the ground...",46,2025-04-25 03:57:26,2752,https://thehill.com/policy/international/5266321-china-cancels-us-pork-ships/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR6D7e3roqKRIakomSeuVRIKrgk7JBxMDTLzVxVKCPvSdLpUzYf3mPo-DZ8B7g_aem_EwPj3iVLLWLTmRMyIaecTQ,NEGATIVE,-0.7628092765808105

Prime example.  Donald Trump's Atlantic City Casinos filed for bankruptcy FOUR times between 1991 and 2014!  Casinos don't make money, they print money!

How financially inept does a business have to be, to go into bankruptcy FOUR times in the casino business? 

And now he's pretending to run the country?  His business prowess can't even run a craps table!

Fingers crossed that the mid-term elections bring fresh members to the US House and Senate to the table that actually have backbones.

Removing that dependency has probably always been in their long term planning but they would be very conscious of the likely enormous dislocation and economic challenge it would cause. Well, Trump just handed them the gift of the century by taking the blame for all of it. I suspect even if Trump dropped the US tariffs today, China wouldn't change theirs now.

This has been known since Trump first mentioned the tariffs. 

A perfect example is Papa John's when the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was rolled out. The law states that companies with 30+ workers had to provide health insurance. 

Papa John's was furious, since they were legally not even having to pay their drivers minimum wage, since they got tips. The next thing they did was why I've boycotted them ever since. 

They said, fine. If we have to pay more to our employees, we are passing it on to our customers. So they retaliated by raising the price of pizza, to punish their customers (voters).

A company that profits millions of years, not willing to let it affect their wallets. 

China is not going to lose any money from these tariffs. They will pass the cost on to consumers. 

The last, and most important part, is Temu. 

Temu is growing a customer base faster than Amazon did. Amazon cannot undercut their prices. While I don't find it a coincidence, Amazon announced they will start selling low priced goods, like Temu, right around the time Trump announced the tariffs. 

It seems Trump is doing the tariffs thing to help the richest man in the world, while he's obviously making deals with Elon Musk as well.

You make a block and it costs 50 cents to build this block.

You now need to sell this block to buy more stuff to make more blocks, and pay the people making the block.

So you sell the block for 1 dollar to a company that will sell it to America. That leaves 50 cents to buy the stuff to make new block and 50 cents to pay workers and costs for factory and machines and wages.

So an American company buys that block for a dollar, and marks it up to $2.50 so it has enough to buy another block, pay wages store rent etc.

Add Trump Tariff of 100% to block made in China. Now the block costs $2 instead of 1$ and whne the American company or store buys it, needs to mark it up to $5 because if he sells it cheaper, he goes out of business. Basic business. So when you are at the grocery store, your block now costs $5 It is just that basic. 

Now no one needs to worry. Trump has said he is going to destroy the USA Education system, so odds are pretty good that so many people who don't see how Tariffs will raise the prices won't need to worry, as they won't be taught how things work.
